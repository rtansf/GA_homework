1. Problem to be solved

Given a MIDI sound file of a piece of classical music, classify the piece by the period to which it
 belongs. In Western classical music, the periods are: Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and 
Modern. This is an example of music classification.

2. Description of Dataset

The dataset will consist of a corpus of works (in MIDI files) sourced from www.piano-midi.de and 
www.classicalmidiconnection,com. The python library, music21 will be used to convert the MIDI files 
into musical Score objects which can then be used to extract quantifiable features. Examples of 
features would be mean and standard deviation of pitches, note durations, tempo, divergence from the 
original key (the fraction of notes that do not belong in the musical scale of the original key).


3. Hypothesis

The hypothesis is based on the assumption that each classical period  has its individual style which
 can be quantified into features mentioned above. The model could be trained to recognize the
features which are associated with a period and be able to predict the period to which a piece belongs.

4. Algorithms

This is a categorical classification problem, and given that the number of features are relatively few,
I will use the supervised learning models such as KNN, Naive-Bayes. I will also use an
unsupervised clustering algorithm such as KMeans to compare against the supervised ones.

5. Applications for the finding
